Match:  e b y the summer of 1791, after his victories in his skirmishes with jefferson and madison over public credit, assumption, and a central bank, hamilton had attained the summit of his power. such stellar success might have bred an intoxicating sense of invincibility. but his vigorous reign had also made him the enfant terrible of the early republic, and a substantial minority of the country was mobilized against him. this should have made him especially watchful of his reputation. instead, in one of history's most mystifying cases of bad judgment, he entered into a sordid affair with a married woman named maria reynolds that, if it did not blacken his name forever, certainly sullied it. from the lofty heights of statesmanship, hamilton fell back into something reminiscent of the squalid world of his west indian boyhood. philadelphia
