## Extracting quotations from long form documents


The accelerating decline in book reading among
youth indicates an imminent issue with their mar-
keting. If the current trend continues, literary read-
ing will disappear in half a century. On the contrary,
filmmaking has figured out various ways to grat-
ify the audience instantly. We believe providing
powerful quotations while previewing books can
engage readers.
Formally, given a book, we extract quotes
from it that people could find interesting. We use
Transformer models to identify potential quotes
in a book, similar to reading comprehension
and summarization tasks, and further prune the
predictions with classification techniques. Initial
results have corroborated that the language models
can capture such intriguing lines in long-form
documents
